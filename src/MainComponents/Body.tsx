            The solo queue grind has been a constant struggle <br />
            that many gamers go through and as a result it <br />
            brings many defeats. Many games follow these same <br />
            ideas, but games such as Overwatch heavily focus on teamwork. 
            Without proper communication and roles the odds of a 
            loss are much higher than that of a win.

            When playing video games there's always a meta to follow.
            Many times the meta isn't the characters that you want to play,
            this leads to the game being not fun. It's even less fun when the 
            characters don't work together, therefore ending a loss.
